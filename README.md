# Montessorieffect

![]( images/montessorieffect_titel.png "Logo Title Text 1")
 
An education platform that enable users who homeschool children find free Montessori resources. There is an admin dashboard where the activities can be created, and the user can use the website to search these activities by entering a keyword or using some filters. The user can get more details/instructions and also be able to download printable materials.

To create this project, I've combined my two passions Montessori Education and Developing! I've developed this full-stack website from scratch designing the backend with a Django framework and Python and writing a user friendly frontend with HTML and CSS.
