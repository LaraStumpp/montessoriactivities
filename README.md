# Montessorieffect

This site is an education platform that enables users who homeschool children to find free Montessori resources. It comes with an admin dashboard where activities can be created and managed. 

Users can use the Montessori site to search these activities by entering a keyword or using some filters. The user can get more details/instructions and is also be able to download printable materials.

To create this project, I've combined my two passions Montessori education and developing! I've developed this full-stack website from scratch designing the backend with a Django framework and Python and writing a user friendly frontend with HTML and CSS, leveraging a bootstrap template.
